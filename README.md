SFML PONG GAME
_____________________________________________

NOTE: Sound and Score system codes are exist in main.cpp but commented because (I use VS Code with SFML(MinGW)) gives error 
while try to load font. Also, sound system gives error. I tried to fix both but didn't work, but i think codes are correct, so that lines are commented.        
I didn't add sfml files you can create src folder and copy "lib" and "include" folders from SFML(MinGW) there, makefile is exist already.
